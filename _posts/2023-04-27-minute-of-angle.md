title: "Long range shooting: Minute of angle"

_Minute of angle_ (MOA) is a unit of angular measurement, like [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)) or [radian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian). It is a subdivision of a degree, 1/60th. Just as there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, there are 60 minutes in 1 degree. Minutes of angle are used as a common unit to describe sight corrections in long range shooting.

The rule of thumb is, _1MOA equates to 1 inch per 100 yards_. So if you were shooting at 300 yards, and the bullet impact was 3 inches to the right of centre, you would compensate by adjusting your sight by 1MOA to the left, and take another shot anticipating a more accurate impact.

Dusting off some trigonometry from high school, we can generate a slightly more precise table of MOA conversions for common shooting distances. If we assume:
- the line of aim is at the target centre
- the target is [perpendicular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpendicular) to the line of aim

then we can represent the scenario with a diagram.

- the shooter's eye is at `A`
- bullet impact is at `B`
- the target centre is at `C`
- the line of aim is `AC`
- the distance to target is `b`
- we suppose the angle `BAC` is equal to 1MOA
- solve for `a`

[Trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions) tells us
```
      tan(Ã˜) = opposite / adjacent
    tan(BAC) = a / b
tan(BAC) * b = a
```
_Converting as needed to ensure suitable units._

So the rule of thumb is pretty good, but the further you are from your target, a larger error starts to appear.

For competition long range shooting the targets have codified dimensions - see chapter 13 of the Standard Shooting Rules published by the [National Rifle Association of Australia](https://nraa.com.au/). If you know how big the target rings are, given a point of impact, you can estimate the vertical and horizontal sight adjustments required to produce more accurate shots. Sights on precision rifles often adjust by fractions of a minute - third, quarter, even eighth-minute increments, to enable very fine adjustments at long range.
